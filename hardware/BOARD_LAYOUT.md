# Board Layout Guide

This is the second document that answers **"How?"** — the companion to the Architecture document, and follow up to the Schematic Design document. It covers the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) selection and layout rules for **OPNhydro**.

As in the Schematic Design document, the central problem remains **coexistence**.
- On one side: a pH probe measuring millivolt-level electrochemical potentials, an EC probe and an ESP32 that needs a clean analog supply. 
- On the other: three stepper drivers chopping current at 20–50 kHz, a buck converter switching at 1 MHz, and a solenoid valve.

After the PCB selection and general layout rules, we'll cover the different sections of the schematic.


## 1. PCB Selection and General Rules

Zl = 1 / j omega L
Xl = 1 / 2 pi f L

Z = ESR + Xc + Xl
the dip in |Z| is ESR
